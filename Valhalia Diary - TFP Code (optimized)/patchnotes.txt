1.3.2 - "Starlit Cafe"

Small bit of optimization done to the game. The game should now feel faster, at least a little (or more, depending on your system)

The laptop puzzle is completely removed now as we are gearing up to replace it.

Kohaku's now got a voice, as provided by Zel this time!
Zel's work can be heard throughout chapter one, but only chapter one at this time.
Me and the team gave Doki a solid farewell salute for the work she did early on.

The game now asks you if you want to turn the sparkle system on or off upon starting a new game!
This can be changed later in the options if you change your mind. Do note the sparkle system applies to key items only, and not diary shards.

Iconset is slowly being updated in this release. It's not fully finished, but there is now a much better styling to the icons in the inventory!

Social media buttons have been added to the title screen, which link back to my tumblr about the game, the patreon page, as well as the SPL twitter!

Audio enhancements have been added, such as the game now stopping all audio when out of focus, and resuming when in focus.

The game now takes up less storage space compared to before, which should make the download less painful.
